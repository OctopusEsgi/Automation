# Automation

This part concerns the automation of node deployment on the Octopus project. 

The use of Terraform and Ansible seemed necessary for the smooth running of the project. 

We are beginners in creating Terraform and Ansible scripts as well as in their linkage, and we have learned self-taught. 

The creation of nodes is done in a Vsphere environment and the main.tf script has therefore been made accordingly. It is obviously possible to adapt it so that it is compatible with other platforms such as AWS

Thank you !
